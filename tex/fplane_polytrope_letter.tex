\begin{abstract}
Here we study numerical simulations of stratified, compressible convection in a
rotational $f$-plane geometry. We discuss how the rotational constraint,
measured by the Rossby number (Ro), can vary as a function of the convective driving,
measured by the Rayleigh number (Ra). We define a relationship between Ra and the
Taylor number (Ta) which we call the Predictive Rossby Number, 
\pro = Ra / Ta$^{3/4}$, and we find that the Ro remains roughly constant
across orders of magnitude of Ra when \pro is fixed.

%%%%% Body of the paper
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Convection under the influence of rotation has been studied in great detail in
recent decades. In the incompressible boussinesq case, numerous authors have
studied rotating convection in both laboratory and numerical settings. The
behavior of the heat transport in these systems has been the focus of many
of these studies, particularly the difference of behavior of heat transport
in rotationally-constrained and unconstrained regimes 
\citep{king&all2009, zhong&all2009, stevens&all2009, julien&all2012}. 
Studies of both laboratory (cite, cite) and numerical (cite, cite) experiments
coincide well in these regimes.

More complicated experiments of rotational convection are often conducted
using numerical tools in spherical geometries. Often these studies aim to
gain insight into the solar dynamo \citep{glatzmaier&gilman1982, busse2002, brown&all2008,
brown&all2010, brown&all2011, augustson&all2012, guerrero&all2013, kapyla&all2014}.
Numerous interesting phenomenological discoveries have been made in such studies,
but they often employ very different degrees of rotational constraint, and their
basic system behavior often differs significantly from the Sun. For example, 
dynamo simulations often produce antisolar differential rotation profiles at
nominally solar values of rotational constraint.

In recent years, helioseismic imaging of flows in the Sun have suggested that
power in large-scale convective motions is much lower than convective simulations
and mixing length theory predict \citep{hanasoge&all2012, greer&all2015L}.
This suggests that either convection is not driven deep in the solar convection
zone or its motions are masked before they reach the surface by some process.
It has been suggested that the
interior convection zone is rotationally constrained, and that this behavior is
reducing low wavenumber power at the surface. The recent simulations of
\cite{featherstone&hindman2016} and the observations of \cite{greer&all2016} 
support this hypothesis.  The degree of rotational constraint
under which convective flows occur can greatly change the character of the
resultant situation, and so in the case of astrophysical contexts (solar studies
such as those mentioned above and also planetary studies such as e.g., 
\cite{soderlund&all2015, aurnou&king2017}), it is important to study convection in the same
rotational regime as the astrophysical object of interest in order to meaningfully
understand results.

\end{figure*}


One difficulty in studying rotational convection is that it is often unclear
from input parameters whether or not the resulting convective state will be rotationally
constrained. In \cite{anders&brown2017} (hereafter \AB), we studied non-rotating, hydrodynamic, 
compressible convection. We showed how the evolved Reynolds number, Peclet number
(Re and Pe, two measures of turbulence in the evolved state), and Mach number
(Ma, the ratio of flow speed to the local sound speed) of the convective solution
can be specified through a properly constructed reference atmosphere. Upon the inclusion
of rotation, a fourth dynamical measure of the solution becomes meaningful: the
Rossby number (Ro, the ratio of advective dynamics to rotational constraint). Low
Ro flows are rotationally constrained, while high Ro flows are not. While the literature
contains a wealth of information regarding how the magnitude of rotation affects the
heat transport characteristics of convection, we find no work which links
the rotational constraint of evolved solutions with input parameters.

In this work, we extend the study of \AB$\,$ to rotationally-influenced, $f$-plane
polytropic atmospheres, as have been previously studied by e.g.,
\cite{brummell&all1996, brummell&all1998, calkins&all2015a}. Our goal is to determine
how the input parameters which we studied previously couple with a new input
parameter, the Taylor number (Ta, \cite{julien&all1996}), which sets the magnitude of the
rotational vector. In section  \ref{sec:experiment}, we describe our atmosphere, numerical
experiment, and paths through parameter space. In section \ref{sec:results}, we present
the results of our experiments and in section \ref{sec:discussion} we offer concluding remarks.

\section{Experiment} 
\label{sec:experiment}


We study fully compressible, stratified 
convection under precisely the same atmospheric model
as we previously did in \AB, but here
we have included rotation. We study polytropic atmospheres
with $n_\rho = 3$ density scale heights and a superadiabatic
excess of $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ such that flows are at low Mach number.
As in previous work \citep{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996}, 
we study a domain in which the
gravity, $\bm{g} = -g\hat{z}$, and rotational vector, $\bm{\Omega} = \Omega \hat{z}$, 
are antiparallel.

We evolve the velocity ($\bm{u}$), temperature ($T$), and log density ($\ln\rho$) according to the
Fully Compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the same form presented in \AB, with the
addition of the Coriolis term, $2\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{u}$, to the left-hand side
of the momentum equation.

\begin{figure*}[t!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/dynamics_plot.png}
\caption{ Here's some pretty plots, we'll figure out what we plot later.
\label{fig:pretty_convection} }
\end{figure*}


The kinematic viscosity ($\nu$), thermal diffusivity ($\chi$), and strength of
rotation ($\Omega$) are set at the top of the domain by the Rayleigh number
(Ra), Prandtl number (Pr), and Taylor number (Ta),
\begin{equation}
\text{Ra} = \frac{g L_z^3 \Delta S / c_P}{\nu \chi}, \,\,\,
\text{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\chi}, \,\,\,
\text{Ta} = \left(\frac{2 \Omega L_z^2}{\nu}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where $L_z$ is the depth of the domain, 
$\Delta S = \epsilon n_\rho / m$ is the specific entropy difference between
$z = 0$ and $z = L_z$, and the specific heat at constant pressure is $c_P$.
Throughout this work we set Pr = 1.

As Ta increases, the critical value of Ra at which convection onsets,
Ra$_{\text{crit}}$, also increases (see the black line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a). 
The linked nature of these crucial
control parameters makes it difficult to predict the rotational constraint of the evolved
fluid flows for a given set of input parameters. In this work, we will
explore three paths through Ra-Ta space:
\begin{equation}
\text{Ra} = 
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{S}\,\text{Ra}_\text{crit}(\text{Ta}), & (\text{I})\\
\text{Co}^2\text{Pr Ta}, & (\text{II}) \\
\pro^2 \text{Pr Ta}^{3/4} & (\text{III}).
\end{cases}
\label{eqn:paths}
\end{equation}
Paths on constraint I are at constant supercriticality, $\mathcal{S}$
(orange dash-dot line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).
Paths on constraint II are at a constant value of the classic
``Convective Rossby number'' (Co), which has been used frequently over the past
two decades, and is intended to predict the rotational constraint of the
evolved solution (red line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a; 
\citet{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996}). Paths on constraint
III set constant a ratio which we call the ``Predictive Rossby Number'' (\pro).
These paths follow contours of Ta$^{3/4}$, and to our knowledge have not been
well-explored in the literature (blue solid line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).  




In this work, our goal is to study the magnitude of the rotational constraint
along each path defined in Eqn. \ref{eqn:paths}. We will quantify rotational
constraint using the Rossby number,
\begin{equation}
\text{Ro} = \frac{|\grad\times \bm{u}|}{2 \Omega}.
\label{eqn:ro}
\end{equation}

As Ta increases, the wavenumber of convective onset, $k_{\text{crit}}$, also increases. 
We study 3D cartesian convective domains with horizontal extents of
$x, y = [0, 4(2\pi/k_{\text{crit}})]$. 
We evolve our simulations using the Dedalus\footnote{\url{http://dedalus-project.org/}} 
pseudospectral framework, and our numerical methods are identical to those presented
in \AB.



\section{Results \& Discussion}

\label{sec:results}
In Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a, we display the value of the critical Rayleigh number 
(Ra$_{\text{crit}}$) as a function of the Taylor number (Ta). We found these critical
values through the use of a linear instability analysis. We plot a sample path for
each criterion in Eqn. \ref{eqn:paths} through
this parameter space.
In Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}b, we show that along paths of
constant $\mathcal{S}$, Ro 
decreases as a function of Ra and Ta. Along paths of constant Co, Ro increases
with increasing Ra and Ta. However, along paths of constant \pro, 
after an increase at low Ra, the evolved value of Ro levels off and stays roughly constant
as a function of Ra. Holding \pro constant seems to predict Ro relatively
well from our experimental trials here, particularly at low Ro. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}c, we
show how the Ro varies as a function of \pro at constant supercriticality.
We expect the scaling law for Ro $\leq 0.4$ to hold up to low Ro, and the
leveling off seen at higher Ro and higher \pro is likely influenced by the
curvature of the supercriticality curve at low Ra and Ta (see Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).


\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{./figs/nu_and_re.png}
\caption{(a) Evolved Nu vs. Ra along constant
\pro$\,$ paths. A scaling law of $Nu \propto Ra^{0.27}$ is observed, which
is very similar to classic scaling laws.
(b) Evolved Re vs. Ra along constant \pro$\,$ paths.
A classic scaling law of $Re \propto Ra^{1/2}$ is observed. The
similarity between these laws and
classical laws in \RB convection suggests that at fixed \pro, varying Ra
affects the evolved dynamics in a manner similar to a nonrotating fluid.
\label{fig:nu_and_re} }
\end{figure}

We define the Nusselt number (Nu, which quantifies heat transport in a convective
solution) as we did previously in \AB.
In Fig. \ref{fig:nu_and_re}a, we show the scaling of Nu as a function
of Ra at fixed \pro. We find that when \pro$\,$ is held constant and
Ra is increased, we find a scaling of $\text{Nu} \propto \text{Ra}^{0.27}$,
which is reminiscent of classical scaling laws in non-rotating theory,
and suggests that changes in heat transport along these paths are boundary
driven. Furthermore, in Fig. \ref{fig:nu_and_re}b, we plot the RMS Reynold's
number (Re $= |u| L_z / \nu$) as a function of Ra, and find that 
$\text{Re} \propto \text{Ra}^{1/2}$, which is precisely the scaling we found
in the non-rotating regime in \AB.


In Fig. \ref{fig:pretty_convection}, we show sample snapshots of the convective flows in
our domain. I'll need to talk about them once I get there.

\begin{figure*}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/boundary_layers.png}
\caption{(a) Horizontally-averaged profiles of the Rossby number are shown
vs. z for a constant \pro$\,$ = X. (b) Horizontally-averaged profiles of 
the entropy gradient are shown vs. z for a constant \pro$\,$ = X.
(c) Vorticity boundary layer thickness normalized by entropy boundary layer
thickness as a function of Ta/Ta\_crit for multiple \pro$\,$ paths.
When this measure is $\gg 1$, we expect the flows to be buoyancy dominated,
when it is $\ll 1$, we expect the flows to be rotationally dominated,
and when it is $\sim 1$, we anticipate that both effects are very important.
\label{fig:profiles_and_bls} }
\end{figure*}

In Fig. \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}, we show time- and horizontally-averaged profiles of
the rossby number and the entropy gradient. As Ra increases at a constant value of
\pro, both the entropy and rotational boundary layers shrink. We measure the
upper boundary layer thicknesses of both profiles. We measure the boundary layer thickness
of the Rossby number as the distance from the upper boundary to the point at which Ro
is maximized. We measure the boundary layer thickness of the entropy profile by fitting
a line to the upper 10 points in the domain, and assuming that the boundary layer extends to
the point at which that line crosses through zero. We plot $\delta_S/\delta_{\text{Ro}}$
as a function of Ra for our \pro$\,$ paths in Fig. \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}b. We find
that the ratio of these boundary layers is relatively constant as a fucntion of Ra, which
implies that the rotational constraint across Ra is roughly constant.
[NOTE: NEED TO TALK ABOUT MAGNITUDE OF RO IN BOUNDARY LAYER]

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In this letter, we studied rotating, stratified, compressible convection at low Mach 
number. We studied traditional paths through Ra-Ta space, as well as a new path,
in which the Predictive Rossby number, \pro, is held constant, and
$\text{Ra} = \pro \text{Ta}^{3/4}$. Along these paths, we find that the evolved
rotational constraint, as measured by the Rossby number (Ro), is roughly constant as
Ra increases. Furthermore, the heat transport, measured by the Nusselt number (Nu), and the
level of turbulence, as measured by the Reynolds number (Re), vary according to traditional 
scaling laws as Ra increases. Together, these phenomena suggest that experimenters in
stratified convection can specify the degree of rotational constraint in their evolved
solutions by choosing \pro$\,$, and then increase Ra in a manner analogous to 
unrotating convection (e.g., \AB) to increase the efficiency and turbulent nature of the
convective dynamics in question.
