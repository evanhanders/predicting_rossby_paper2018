\begin{abstract}
In this letter we study numerical simulations of stratified, compressible convection in a
rotational $f$-plane geometry. We define a new quantity, the Predictive Rossby number
(\pro), and show that it specifies the evolved rotational constraint of simulation as
measured by the Rossby number (Ro).
We examine the scaling of traditional fluid numbers and boundary layers along paths of constant
\pro.

%% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Rotation influences the dynamics of convective flows in
stellar and planetary atmospheres.
An abundance of studies into the fundamental nature of
rotating convection in both laboratory and numerical settings
have provided great insight into the properties of convection 
in both the rapidly rotating regime 
\citep{julien&all2012, stellmach&all2014, gastine&all2016}
and the rotationally unconstrained regime \citep{king&all2009, zhong&all2009, 
cheng&all2015}. The scaling behavior of heat transport, the nature of convective flow
structures, and the importance of boundary layers in driving dynamics are well known,
and yet we authors are not aware of a well-developed
procedure for specifying the significance of rotation on the evolved
convective flows in the experimental initial conditions.
The importance of rotation on convective dynamics,
measured by the evolved Rossby number
(Ro, the ratio of convective to rotational vorticity),
is in general not held constant in parameter space studies and is often not even
reported.

In the astrophysical context,
many studies of rotating convection have investigated questions inspired by the solar dynamo
\citep{glatzmaier&gilman1982, busse2002, brown&all2008,
brown&all2010, brown&all2011, augustson&all2012, guerrero&all2013, kapyla&all2014}.
Even when these simulations nominally rotate at the solar rate,
they frequently produce distinctly different behaviors than the true Sun,
such as anti-solar differential rotation profiles.
These unphysical results may arise from the fact that Ro in these simulations differs from
its value the Sun. Recent simulations and experiments predict
that Ro in the deep solar interior is very small, implying that deep solar convection
is highly rotationally constrained, and this likely drastically
affects the behavior of solar convection
\citep{featherstone&hindman2016, greer&all2016}.
In the planetary context, the balance between Lorentz
and rotational forces likely leads to the observed differences between ice
giant and gas giant dynamos in our solar system \citep{soderlund&all2015}.
\cite{aurnou&king2017} suggest that many studies in planetary systems
have likely over-emphasized the importance of magnetism compared to rotation.

In short, simulations must have flows
at the proper Rossby number if they are to have any hope of explaining the behavior of
astrophysical objects.
In this letter, our goal is to experimentally explore methods of specifying the Rossby number
of convection in a simplified system.
In \cite{anders&brown2017} (hereafter \AB), we studied non-rotating, hydrodynamic, 
compressible convection in polytropic atmospheres. 
In this work, we extend the study of \AB$\,$ to rotationally-influenced, $f$-plane
atmospheres, as have been previously studied by e.g.,
\cite{brummell&all1996, brummell&all1998, calkins&all2015a}. Our goal is to determine
how the input parameters which we studied previously (which control the Mach number and
Reynolds number of the evolved flows) couple with a new input
parameter, the Taylor number (Ta, \cite{julien&all1996}), which sets the magnitude of the
rotational vector. 

In section  \ref{sec:experiment}, we describe our experiment and paths through parameter space. 
In section \ref{sec:results}, we present
the results of our experiments and in section \ref{sec:discussion} we offer concluding remarks.

%% EXPERIMENT SECTION
\section{Experiment} 
\label{sec:experiment}
We study fully compressible, stratified 
convection under precisely the same atmospheric model
as we previously did in \AB, but here
we have included rotation. We study polytropic atmospheres
with $n_\rho = 3$ density scale heights and a superadiabatic
excess of $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ such that flows are at low Mach number.
As in previous work \citep{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996}, 
we study a domain in which the
gravity, $\bm{g} = -g\hat{z}$, and rotational vector, $\bm{\Omega} = \Omega \hat{z}$, 
are antiparallel.

We evolve the velocity ($\bm{u}$), temperature ($T$), 
and log density ($\ln\rho$) according to the
Fully Compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the same form presented in \AB, with the
addition of the Coriolis term, $2\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{u}$, to the left-hand side
of the momentum equation. We impose impenetrable, stress-free, fixed-temperature boundary
conditions at the top and bottom of the domain.


The kinematic viscosity ($\nu$), thermal diffusivity ($\chi$), and strength of
rotation ($\Omega$) are set at the top of the domain by the Rayleigh number
(Ra), Prandtl number (Pr), and Taylor number (Ta),
\begin{equation}
    \text{Ra} = \frac{g L_z^3 \Delta S / c_P}{\nu \chi}, \,\,\,
    \text{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\chi}, \,\,\,
    \text{Ta} = \left(\frac{2 \Omega L_z^2}{\nu}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where $L_z$ is the depth of the domain, 
$\Delta S = \epsilon n_\rho / m$ is the specific entropy difference between
$z = 0$ and $z = L_z$, and the specific heat at constant pressure is $c_P$.
Throughout this work we set Pr = 1.

As Ta increases, the wavenumber of convective onset, $k_{\text{crit}}$, also increases
\citep{calkins&all2015a}. 
We study 3D cartesian convective domains with horizontal extents of
$x, y = [0, 4(2\pi/k_{\text{crit}})]$. 
We evolve our simulations using the Dedalus\footnote{\url{http://dedalus-project.org/}} 
pseudospectral framework, and our numerical methods are identical to those presented
in \AB.

%% DYNAMICS FIGURE
\begin{figure*}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dynamics_plot.png}
    \caption{ A horizontal slice of the evolved entropy field is plotted at $z = 0.95L_z$
    for select simulations. The mean value of entropy at this height has been removed in all
    cases. All runs displayed here have an evolved volume-averaged Re$\,\sim\,200$. 
    As Ro decreases from O(1) on the left to O(0.1) on the right, and thus the rotational
    constraint on the flow increases, significant changes in flow morphology are observed.
    At Ro = 2.01, convective dynamics are not hugely dissimilar from the non-rotating
    case where there are large upflows and narrow, fast downflow lanes (see e.g., \AB).
    As the rotational constraint increases, the granular convective pattern gives way
    to vortical columns, as seen at Ro = 0.13.
    \label{fig:pretty_convection} }
\end{figure*}

As Ta increases, the critical value of Ra at which convection onsets,
Ra$_{\text{crit}}$, also increases (see the black line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a). 
The linked nature of these crucial
control parameters makes it difficult to predict the rotational constraint of the evolved
fluid flows for a given set of input parameters. In this work, we will
explore three paths through Ra-Ta space:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Ra} = 
    \begin{cases}
    \mathcal{S}\,\text{Ra}_\text{crit}(\text{Ta}), & (\text{I})\\
    \text{Co}^2\text{Pr Ta}, & (\text{II}) \\
    \pro^2 \text{Pr Ta}^{3/4} & (\text{III}).
    \end{cases}
    \label{eqn:paths}
\end{equation}
Paths on constraint I are at constant supercriticality, 
$\mathcal{S} \equiv \text{Ra}/\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}}$
(blue dash-dot line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).
Paths on constraint II are at a constant value of the classic
``Convective Rossby number'' (Co$^2$ = Ra / [Pr Ta]), which has been used frequently 
in past work, and is intended to predict the Rossby number of the
evolved solution (green dashed line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a; 
\citet{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996}). Paths on constraint
III set constant a ratio which we call the ``Predictive Rossby Number,'' 
$\pro^2 = \text{Ra}/(\text{Pr}\text{Ta}^{3/4})$, 
(e.g., orange solid line in Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).
To our knowledge, these paths have not been explored
in the literature.



For each path defined in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:paths}, 
our goal is to study the magnitude, and variation as
a function of Ta, of the Rossby number,
\begin{equation}
    \text{Ro} = \frac{|\grad\times \bm{u}|}{2 \Omega},
    \label{eqn:ro}
\end{equation}
which quantifies the degree to which the fluid is rotationally constrained.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% RESULTS SECTION
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_space}a, the value of Ra$_{\text{crit}}$
is shown as a function of Ta, as
calculated by a linear instability analysis. A sample path for
each criterion in Eqn. \ref{eqn:paths} through
this parameter space is shown.
In Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}b, we display the scaling of Ro
with increasing Ra along various paths through parameter space.
We find that Ro increases on constant Co paths, decreases on constant $\mathcal{S}$
paths, and remains roughly constant along constant \pro$\,$ paths.
In Fig. \ref{fig:parameter_space}c, the behavior of Ro is shown as
a function of \pro$\,$ at constant $\mathcal{S}$.
At low Ro and \pro, in the rotationally constrained regime, the two parameters
are related according to the power law [INSERT HERE ONCE MORE DATA].
At higher Ro in the rotationally unconstrained regime, this scaling breaks down
to a [INSERT SCALING], with some offset at different values of $\mathcal{S}$.

    \includegraphics{./figs/nu_and_re.png}
    \caption{Scaling laws for paths at $\pro = 1.58$ (Ro $\sim$ 0.4) and
    $\pro = 0.96$ (Ro $\sim$ 0.1) are shown. 
    (a) Evolved Nu vs. Ra. The scaling laws here are very reminiscent of classic \RB convection
    theory \citep{ahlers&all2009}.
    (b) Evolved Re vs. Ra.
    The scaling seen here is nearly identical to scalings in nonrotating convection.
    \label{fig:nu_and_re} }

%% BOUNDARY LAYER FIGURE
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/boundary_layers.png}
    \caption{Horizontally-averaged profiles of the entropy gradient ($\grad s$, a)
    and Rossby number (Ro, b) are shown vs. height for $\pro = 0.96$. 
    Similar profiles are shown in (c) and (d) for $\pro = 1.58$. 
    (c) The ratio of the sizes of the Ro boundary layer and $\grad s$ boundary layer are
    shown. We find that for increasingly rotationally constrained flows, the Ro boundary layer
    is increasingly thinner than the thermal boundary layer.
    \label{fig:profiles_and_bls} }
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:pretty_convection}, sample snapshots
of the evolved entropy field in the $x-y$ plane near the top of the domain are shown. 
In the left panel is a rotationally unconstrained flow at moderately high
Ro, and Ro decreases into the rotationally constrained regime from left to right.
As Ro decreases, the
classic granular structure of convection (see e.g., Fig.~2 in \AB) gives way to vortical
columns of convection, as seen in rapidly rotating \RB convection \citep{stellmach&all2014}.
The select cases displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:pretty_convection} have an evolved volume-averaged
Re$\,\sim\,$200.

We measure the Nusselt number (Nu, which quantifies heat transport in a convective
solution) as we did in \AB.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:nu_and_re}a, we show how Nu scales as a function
of Ra at fixed \pro. When Ro$\,\sim\,$0.1,
we find a scaling of $\text{Nu} \propto \text{Ra}^{0.27}$. This is reminiscent of
classic scaling laws (e.g., Ra$^{2/7}$) in non-rotating \RB convection \citep{ahlers&all2009}.
This suggests that changes in heat transport at constant \pro are driven by
changes in the boundary layer structure with increasing Ra.
In Fig. \ref{fig:nu_and_re}b, we plot the RMS Reynold's
number (Re $= |u| L_z / \nu$) as a function of Ra at fixed \pro, and find that 
$\text{Re} \propto \text{Ra}^{0.47} \sim \text{Ra}^{1/2}$ in the rotationally constrained regime,
which directly parallels the non-rotating regime in \AB.

In Fig. \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}, we show time- and horizontally-averaged profiles of
Ro and the entropy gradient ($\grad s$). As Ra increases at a constant value of
\pro, both the $\grad s$ and Ro boundary layers become thinner. We measure the
thickness of the entropy boundary layer ($\delta_{\grad s}$) at the top of the domain by 
measuring where a linear fit within the boundary layer crosses through $\grad s = 0$.
We ensure by-eye for each profile that this is a reasonable measure of the boundary
layer thickness. We measure
the thickness of the Ro boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{Ro}}$) 
as the height of the peak value of Ro within the
upper half of the domain.
In Fig. \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}e, we plot $\delta_{\text{Ro}}/\delta_{\grad s}$, the ratio
of these two boundary layers. As anticipated, the dynamical boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{Ro}}$)
becomes relatively thinner with respect to the thermal boundary layer ($\delta_{\grad s}$)
as Ro and \pro$\,$ decrease. [need a sentence saying what this means?]

%% CONCLUSION SECTION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In this letter, we studied low-Mach-number, stratified, compressible convection 
under the influence of rotation.
We examined three paths through Ra-Ta space, and showed that in the low-Ro, rotationally
constrained regime, the newly-defined 
Predictive Rossby number, $\pro = \text{Ra}/(\text{Pr }\text{Ta}^{3/4})$, determines the value of
the evolved Ro. While increasing Ra and holding \pro$\,$ constant,
we find scaling laws of heat transport (Nu) and turbulence (Re) that are nearly identical
to scaling laws seen in nonrotational convection.

Our results here suggest that experimenters can
can achieve whatever degree of rotational constraint they desire in their evolved solution
by choosing the proper value of \pro. Once that value is chosen, traditional experiments
in which the turbulent nature of the solutions is increased by increasing Ra can be 
straightforwardly achieved. While here we studied a simple cartesian geometry with antiparallel
gravity and rotation, preliminary results in 3D spherical convective systems suggest
that the results presented here are broadly applicable to rotational convection in
complex geometries (Brown et al. 2019 in prep).
