\begin{abstract}
  The Rossby number is a crucial parameter describing the degree of rotational constraint on the convective dynamics in stars and planets. 
However, it is not an input to computational models of convection but must be measured ex post facto. 
Here, we report the discovery of a new quantity, the Predictive Rossby number, which is both tightly correlated with the Rossby number and specified in terms of common inputs to numerical models. 
The Predictive Rossby number can be specified independent of Rayleigh number, allowing suites of numerical solutions to separate the degree of rotational constraint from the strength of the driving of convection.  
We examine the scaling of convective transport in terms of the Nusselt number and the degree of turbulence in terms of the Reynolds number of the flow. 
Finally, we describe the boundary layers as a function of increasing turbulence at constant Rossby number.

%% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Rotation influences the dynamics of convective flows in
stellar and planetary atmospheres.
Many studies on the fundamental nature of
rotating convection in both laboratory and numerical settings
have provided great insight into the properties of convection 
in both the rapidly rotating regime 
and the transition to the rotationally unconstrained regime 
\citep{king&all2009, zhong&all2009, schmitz&tilgner2009, king&all2012, julien&all2012, king&all2013, ecke&niemela2014, stellmach&all2014, cheng&all2015, gastine&all2016}
The scaling behavior of heat transport, the nature of convective flow
structures, and the importance of boundary layer-bulk interactions in driving dynamics are well known.
Yet, we do not know of any simple procedure for predicting the magnitude of vortical flow gradients 
purely from experimental control parameters, such as bulk rotation rate and thermal input.

In the astrophysical context,
many studies of rotating convection have investigated questions inspired by the solar dynamo
\citep{glatzmaier&gilman1982, busse2002, brown&all2008,
brown&all2010, brown&all2011, augustson&all2012, guerrero&all2013, kapyla&all2014}.
Even when these simulations nominally rotate at the solar rate,
they frequently produce distinctly different behaviors than the true Sun,
such as anti-solar differential rotation profiles  \citep{gastine&all2014}.
It seems that these differences occur because the simulations produce less rotationally 
constrained states than the Sun. 
The influence of rotation results from the local 
shear gradients, and these are not direct input parameters.
Recent simulations predict significant rotational influence in the deep solar interior, 
which can drastically affect flows throughout the solar convection zone 
\citep{featherstone&hindman2016, greer&all2016}. 
In the planetary context, the balance between magnetic
and rotational forces likely leads to the observed differences between ice
giant and gas giant dynamos in our solar system \citep{soderlund&all2015}.
In particular, \cite{aurnou&king2017} suggest that many studies of planetary systems
have over-emphasized the importance of magnetism compared to rotation.

In short, simulations must achieve the proper rotational balance if they are to explain 
the behavior of astrophysical objects. 
In Boussinesq studies, rotational constraint is often measured by comparing
dynamical and thermal boundary layers or deviation in heat transport from the non-rotating
state \citep{king&all2012, julien&all2012, king&all2013}. 
Such measurements are not available for astrophysical objects, where
the degree of rotational influence is best assessed by the ratio between 
nonlinear advection magnitude and the linear Coriolis accelerations. 
The \textit{Rossby number} is the standard measure of this ratio, 
\begin{equation}
\text{Ro} \ \equiv \ \frac{| \nabla \times \boldsymbol{u} | }{2 |\bm{\Omega}|} \ 
\sim \ \frac{| (\nabla \times \boldsymbol{u}) \times \boldsymbol{u}  | }{|2 \bm{\Omega} \times \boldsymbol{u}|},
\label{eqn:rossby-def}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{\Omega}$ denotes the bulk rotation vector. 
Many proxies for the dynamical Rossby number exist that are based solely on input parameters, most notably the \textit{convective} Rossby number. 
However, all proxies produce imperfect predictions for the true dynamically relevant quantity.
\begin{quote}
\emph{In this letter, we demonstrate an emperical method of predicting the output Rossby number
of convection in a simple stratified system.}
\end{quote}
In \cite{anders&brown2017} (hereafter \AB), we studied non-rotating compressible convection without magnetic fields in polytropic atmospheres. 
In this work, we extend \AB$\,$ to rotationally-influenced, $f$-plane
atmospheres 
\cite[e.g.,][]{brummell&all1996, brummell&all1998, calkins&all2015a}. 
We determine how the input parameters we studied previously, which controlled the Mach and
Reynolds numbers of the evolved flows, couple with the Taylor number \citep[Ta,][]{julien&all1996}, which sets the magnitude of the rotational vector. 

In section  \ref{sec:experiment}, we describe our experiment and paths through parameter space. 
In section \ref{sec:results}, we present the results of our experiments and in section \ref{sec:discussion} we offer concluding remarks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% EXPERIMENT SECTION
\section{Experiment} 
\label{sec:experiment}
We study fully compressible, stratified 
convection under precisely the same atmospheric model
as in \AB, but here
we have included rotation. We study polytropic atmospheres
with $n_\rho = 3$ density scale heights and a superadiabatic
excess of $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ such that flows are at low Mach number.
We study a domain in which the
gravity, $\bm{g} = -g\hat{z}$, and rotational vector, $\bm{\Omega} = \Omega \hat{z}$, 
are antiparallel \citep[as in e.g.,][]{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996}.

We evolve the velocity ($\bm{u}$), temperature ($T$), 
and log density ($\ln\rho$) according to the Fully Compressible Navier-Stokes equations
in the same form presented in \AB, with the
addition of the Coriolis term, \mbox{$2\bm{\Omega}\times\bm{u}$}, to the left-hand side
of the momentum equation. 
We impose impenetrable, stress-free, fixed-temperature boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the domain.


We specify the kinematic viscosity ($\nu$), thermal diffusivity ($\chi$), and strength of
rotation ($\Omega$) at the top of the domain by choosing the Rayleigh number 
(Ra), Prandtl number (Pr), and Taylor number (Ta),
\begin{equation}
    \text{Ra} = \frac{g L_z^3 \Delta S / c_P}{\nu \chi}, \,\,\,
    \text{Pr} = \frac{\nu}{\chi}, \,\,\,
    \text{Ta} = \left(\frac{2 \Omega L_z^2}{\nu}\right)^2,
	\label{eqn:input_parameters}
\end{equation}
where $L_z$ is the depth of the domain as defined in \AB, 
$\Delta S \propto \epsilon n_\rho$ is the specific entropy difference between
the top and bottom of the atmosphere, and the specific heat at constant pressure is $c_P = \gamma/(\gamma-1)$
with $\gamma = 5/3$.
Throughout this work we set Pr = 1. The Taylor number relates to the often-quoted
Ekman number by the equality $\text{Ek} \equiv \text{Ta}^{-1/2}$.


The wavenumber of convective onset increases according to $k_{\text{crit}} \propto \text{Ta}^{1/6}$
\citep{Chandrasekhar,calkins&all2015a}.
We study horizontally-periodic, 3D Cartesian domains with extents of
$x, y = [0, 4(2\pi/k_{\text{crit}})]$ and $z = [0, L_z]$. At large values of Ta, these
domains are tall and skinny, as in \cite{stellmach&all2014}.
We evolve our simulations using the Dedalus\footnote{\url{http://dedalus-project.org/}} 
pseudospectral framework, and our numerical methods are identical to those presented
in \AB.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{parameter_space.pdf}
    \caption{(a) The critical Rayleigh number, as a function of the Taylor number, 
    is plotted as a solid black line. The grey shaded region is subcritical, and rotation
    supresses convection there. Paths of constant Convective Rossby number
    ($\con$, green dashed line), constant supercriticality ($\mathcal{S}$, blue dash-dot line), and 
    constant Predictive Rossby number (\pro, orange solid lines) are shown. 
	From thickest to thinnest, paths with $\pro = [1.58, 0.96, 0.6]$ are plotted,
	and the value of
	($\text{Ta}_{\text{crit}}, \text{Ra}_{\text{crit}}$) for each path is denoted by a
	circular marker.
    (b) Evolved Ro is plotted vs. Ra along paths of \pro = [1.58, 0.96, 0.6] for [big, medium, small] orange circles.
    For comparison, paths of constant $\mathcal{S}$ (blue squares, $\mathcal{S} = [3,2]$ 
    for [big, small] squares)
    and constant $\con$ (green triangles, $\con$ = [1, 0.3, 0.1] for [big, medium, small] triangles) are shown.
%    Ro is roughly constant for a constant \pro 
%    but changes drastically at constant $\con$ or $\mathcal{S}$.
    (c) The evolved value of Ro is shown as a function of $\pro$ and $\con$. 
	Each of the experiments in (b) is outlined by a black (circle, triangle, square)
	for points along constant (\pro, \con, $\mathcal{S}$) paths.
	The color inside of the marker represents the exact measured Ro of that experiment, 
	while the colormap outside of markers is a linear interpolation
	of the data set. 
    \label{fig:parameter_space} }
\end{figure*}


The critical value of Ra at which convection onsets also depends on Ta (see the black line in figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}a),
roughly according to $\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}} \sim \text{Ta}^{2/3}$ \citep{Chandrasekhar,calkins&all2015a}.
%We have confirmed these scalings of $\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}}(\text{Ta})$ and 
%$k_{\text{crit}}(\text{Ta})$ in our atmospheres using a linear
%stability analysis.
Even taking account of linear theory, the dependence of the evolved nonlinear fluid 
flows on the input parameters makes predicting the rotational constraint very challenging. 
We will explore three paths through Ra-Ta space:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Ra} = 
    \begin{cases}
    \mathcal{S}\,\text{Ra}_\text{crit}(\text{Ta}), & (\text{I})\\
    (\con)^2 \, \text{Pr}\, \text{Ta}, & (\text{II}) \\
    (\pro)^2\, \text{Pr}^{1/2}\, \text{Ta}^{3/4} & (\text{III}).
    \end{cases}
    \label{eqn:paths}
\end{equation}
Paths on constraint I are at constant supercriticality, 
$\mathcal{S} \equiv \text{Ra}/\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}}$
(blue dash-dot line in figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}a).
Paths on constraint II (green dashed line in figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}a)
are at a constant value of the classic
\textit{convective} Rossby number, \con, which has provided \citep[e.g., ][]{julien&all1996, brummell&all1996} 
a common proxy for the degree of rotational constraint,
\begin{equation}
\con \ = \   \sqrt{ \frac{\text{Ra}}{\text{Pr}\, \text{Ta} } } \ 
= \  \frac{1}{2 \Omega } \sqrt{\frac{g \, \Delta  S}{c_{p} L_{z}}}.
\end{equation}
This parameter measures the importance of buoyancy relative to rotation without 
involving dissipation.  
Paths on constraint
III (e.g., orange solid lines in figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}a) 
set constant a ratio which we call the ``Predictive Rossby number,'' 
\begin{equation}
\pro = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Ra}}{\text{Pr}^{1/2}\,\text{Ta}^{3/4}}} \ = \    
\frac{1}{(2 \Omega)^{3/4}} \sqrt{\frac{g \, \Delta  S}{c_{p} \chi^{1/2}}}
\end{equation}
Unlike paths through parameter space which hold \con$\,$ constant,
paths with constant \pro$\,$ 
feel changes in diffusivities but not the depth of the domain.
To our knowledge, these paths have not been reported in the literature, 
although the importance of $\text{Ra}/\text{Ta}^{3/4} = \text{Ra Ek}^{3/2}$
has been independently found by \cite{king&all2012} using a boundary layer
analysis. We compare our results to their theory in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.

%% RESULTS SECTION
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In our stratified domains, for $\text{Ta} \geq 10^5$, 
a best-fit to results from a linear stability
analysis provides $\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}} = 1.459\text{Ta}^{2/3}$ 
and $k_{\text{crit}} = 0.414\text{Ta}^{1/6}$ for direct onset of convection.
In figure~\ref{fig:parameter_space}a, the value of Ra$_{\text{crit}}(\text{Ta})$
is shown. Sample paths for
each criterion in equation~\ref{eqn:paths} through
this parameter space are also shown.
In figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}b, we display the evolution of Ro
with increasing Ra along various paths through parameter space.
We find that Ro increases on constant \con$\,$paths, decreases on constant $\mathcal{S}$
paths, and remains roughly constant along constant \pro$\,$ paths.
In figure \ref{fig:parameter_space}c, the value of Ro is shown simultaneously as
a function of \pro$\,$and \con$\,$for all experiments conducted in this study.
We find a general power-law of the form \mbox{$\text{Ro} = \mathcal{C} \con^{\alpha}\,\pro^{\beta}$}.
In the rotationally-dominated regime where $\text{Ro} < 0.2$ and 
$\text{Re}_{\perp} > 5$ (see Eqn. \ref{eqn:re_defn}),
we find $\alpha = -0.02$, and $\text{Ro}$ can be said to be a function
of $\pro$ alone. Under this assumption, we report a scaling of $\text{Ro} = (0.148 \pm 0.003) \pro^{3.34 \pm 0.07}$.
In the less rotationally dominated regime of $\text{Ro} > 0.2$ and $\text{Re}_{\perp} > 5$, 
we find $\{C, \alpha, \beta\} = \{0.2, -0.19, 1.5\}$.

	at $z = 0.95L_z$ (top row) and $z = 0.5L_z$ (bottom row) are shown for select simulations. 
	All runs displayed here have an evolved volume-averaged $\text{Re}_\perp \approx 32$. 
    As Ro decreases from O(1) on the left to O(0.03) on the right, and thus the rotational
    constraint on the flow increases, significant changes in flow morphology are observed.
    As Ro decreases, Coriolis forces more effectively
    deflect the convective flows, and the classic granular convective pattern gives way
    to vortical columns.

    \label{fig:profiles_and_bls} }
\end{figure*}

In figure~\ref{fig:dynamics_plot}, sample snapshots of the evolved entropy field 
in the $x$-$y$ plane near the top and at the middle of the domain are shown. 
In the left column, flows are at $\text{Ro} \sim 1$ and resemble the classic granular structure 
of nonrotating convection (see e.g., figure~2 in \AB), where intense narrow downflow lanes 
punctuate broad upwellings. Ro decreases from left to right into the rotationally constrained 
regime ($\text{Ro} \sim 0.03$), in which we observe dynamically persistent, warm upflow columns 
surrounded by bulk weak downflow regions. These dynamics are similar to those seen in rapidly 
rotating \RB convection \citep[e.g.,][]{stellmach&all2014}. 
The select cases displayed in figure~\ref{fig:dynamics_plot} each have an evolved volume-averaged
$\text{Re}_{\perp} \approx 32$ (defined below in equation~\ref{eqn:re_defn}).

We measure the Nusselt number (Nu), which quantifies heat transport in a convective
solution, as defined in \AB.
In figure~\ref{fig:nu_and_re}a, we plot Nu as a function
of $\text{Ra}/\text{Ra}_\text{crit}$ at fixed \pro. We find that $\text{Nu} \propto \{\text{Ra}^{0.29 \pm 0.01}, \text{Ra}^{0.29 \pm 0.01}, \text{Ra}^{0.24}\}$
for $\pro = \{0.6, 0.957, 1.58\}$. These scalings are in line with classic 2/7 power law scalings
in \RB convection \citep{ahlers&all2009}, and approach a $\text{Ra}^{1/3}$ scaling, 
which has been predicted when \pro$\,$ is held constant
\citep[see][and section \ref{sec:discussion}]{king&all2012}.

Flows are distinctly different parallel to and perpendicular
from the rotation vector, which aligns with gravity and stratification.
We measure two forms of the RMS Reynolds number,
\begin{equation}
\text{Re}_{\parallel} = \frac{|\bm{u}| L_z}{\nu}, \qquad
\text{Re}_{\perp}     = \frac{|\bm{u}|}{\nu}\frac{2\pi}{k_{\text{crit}}},
\label{eqn:re_defn}
\end{equation}
where the length scale in $\text{Re}_{\perp}$ is the wavelength of convective onset, and is
related to the horizontal extent of our domain (see section \ref{sec:experiment}).
From our work in \AB, we expect the RMS velocity to scale as $|u| \propto \sqrt{\Delta S}$.
By definition, $\nu \propto \sqrt{\text{Ra}/(\text{Pr }\Delta S)}$, and $L_z$ is a constant
set by the stratification while $k_{\text{crit}} \propto \text{Ta}^{1/6}$. Along paths of
constant \pro, we thus expect $\text{Re}_{\parallel} \propto \text{Ra}^{1/2}$ and
$\text{Re}_{\perp} \propto \text{Ra}^{5/18}$ when $\text{Pr}$ is held constant.

In figure \ref{fig:nu_and_re}b, we plot $\text{Re}_{\parallel}$ and $\text{Re}_{\perp}$
as a function of Ra$/\text{Ra}_{\text{crit}}$ at fixed \pro. We find that $\text{Re}_\parallel \propto \{\text{Ra}^{0.44 \pm 0.01}, \text{Ra}^{0.45 \pm 0.01}, \text{Ra}^{0.44}\}$
and $\text{Re}_\perp \propto \{\text{Ra}^{0.22 \pm 0.01}, \\ \text{Ra}^{0.23 \pm 0.01}, \text{Ra}^{0.21}\}$ for
$\pro = \{0.6, 0.957, 1.58\}$. These scalings are similar to but slightly weaker than our
predictions in all cases. Furthermore, $\text{Re}_{\perp}$ collapses for each $\pro\,$ track,
while $\text{Re}_{\parallel}$ experiences an offset
to larger values as $\pro$ shrinks. The offset in $\text{Re}_{\parallel}$ is unsurprising, 
because more rotationally constrained flows result in smaller boundary layers relative to the 
vertical extent of our stratified domain. The horizontal extent of our domain scales with the
strength of rotation, and so regardless of \pro, flows perpendicular
to the rotational and buoyant direction are comparably turbulent at the same 
$\text{Ra}/\text{Ra}_\text{crit}$.
We find $\text{Re}_{\perp}$ and $\text{Re}_{\parallel}$ are, respectively, good proxies for
the horizontal and perpendicular resolution required to resolve an experiment.

Figure \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls} shows time- and horizontally-averaged profiles of
Ro and the standard deviation of the entropy, $\sigma_{\text{s}}$.
Figures \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}a\&b show these profiles for $\pro=1.58$ ($\text{Ro} \approx 0.4$), while
Figures \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}c\&d show these profiles for $\pro=0.96$ ($\text{Ro} \approx 0.1$). The transition
in profile behavior from low Ra (yellow) to high Ra (purple) is denoted by the color of the
profile.
As Ra increases at a constant value of
\pro, both the thermal ($\sigma_{\text{s}}$) and dynamical (Ro) boundary layers become thinner. 
We measure the
thickness of the thermal boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{s}}$) at the top of the domain by 
finding the location of the first maxima of $\sigma_{\text{s}}$ away from the boundary.
We measure
the thickness of the Ro boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{Ro}}$) 
in the same manner.
In figure \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}e, we plot $\delta_{\text{Ro}}/\delta_{\text{s}}$, the ratio
of the sizes of these two boundary layers. As anticipated, the dynamical boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{Ro}}$)
becomes relatively thinner with respect to the thermal boundary layer ($\delta_{\text{s}}$)
as Ro and \pro$\,$ decrease. 
However, the precise scaling of this boundary layer ratio with \pro$\,$ and Ra is unclear, 
and we cannot immediately compare these ratios to similar measures from the \RB convection
literature, such as Fig. 5 of \cite{king&all2013}. They measure the dynamical boundary layer
thickness as the peak location of the horizontal velocities, but our horizontal velocities
are subject to stress-free boundary conditions, and we find that the maxima of horizontal 
velocities occur precisely at the boundaries.
In figure \ref{fig:profiles_and_bls}f, we plot $\delta_\text{s}$ in units of the density
scale height at the top of the atmosphere, and we plot vertical lines when this crosses 1.
We find no systematic change in behavior when $\delta_{\text{s}}$ is smaller than the
local density scale height.

%% CONCLUSION SECTION
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
In this letter, we studied low-Mach-number, stratified, compressible convection 
under the influence of rotation.
We examined three paths through Ra-Ta space, and showed that the newly-defined 
Predictive Rossby number, $\pro = \text{Ra}/(\text{Pr }^{1/2}\text{Ta}^{3/4})$, determines the value of
the evolved Rossby number.

In this work, we experimentally arrived at the 
$\text{Ra}/\text{Ta}^{3/4} = \text{Ra}\,\text{Ek}^{3/2}$
scaling in \pro, but this relationship was independently
discovered by \cite{king&all2012}. Arguing that the thermal boundary layers should
scale as $\delta_{S} \propto \text{Ra}^{-1/3}$ and rotational Ekman boundary layers
should scale as $\delta_{\text{Ro}} \propto \text{Ta}^{-1/4} = \text{Ek}^{1/2}$, they
expect these boundary layers to be equal in size when $\text{Ra}/\text{Ta}^{3/4} \sim 1$.
They demonstrate that when $2 \lesssim\text{Ra}/\text{Ta}^{3/4} \lesssim 20$ flows are in the
transitional regime, and for $\text{Ra}/\text{Ta}^{3/4} \lesssim 2$, flows are rotationally
constrained. We note that Boussinesq values of $\text{Ra}$ and $\text{Ta}$ are not the same as their
values in our stratified domains here, as diffusivities change with depth (see \AB). 
Taking into account this change with depth,
our simulations fall in \cite{king&all2012}'s rotationally constrained
($\pro = 0.6$) and near-constrained transitional regime ($\pro = \{0.957, 1.58\}$).
The measured values of Ro in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_space}b and the observed dynamics
in Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamics_plot} agree with this interpretation.

We note briefly that the scaling $\text{Ra} \propto \text{Ta}^{3/4}$ is very similar to
another theorized boundary between fully rotationally constrained convection and 
partially constrained convection predicted in Boussinesq theory, of 
$\text{Ra} \propto \text{Ta}^{4/5}$ \citep{julien&all2012, gastine&all2016}. This
Ta$^{4/5}$ scaling also arises through arguments of geostrophic balance in the boundary layers,
and is a steeper scaling than the Ta$^{3/4}$ scaling present in \pro.
This suggests that at sufficiently low \pro, a suite of simulations across many orders
of magnitude of Ra will not only have the same volume-averaged value of Ro 
(as in Fig.~\ref{fig:parameter_space}b), but will
also maintain proper force balances within the boundary layers.

Our results suggest that by choosing the desired value of \pro, experimenters
can select the degree of rotational constraint present in their simulations. 
We find that $\text{Ro} \propto \text{Ro}_\text{p}^{3.34 \pm 0.07}$, which is within
2$\sigma$ of the estimate in \cite{king&all2013}, who although defining
Ro very differently from our vorticity-based definition here, find 
$\text{Ro} \propto \text{Ro}_\text{p}^{3.84 \pm 0.28}$. We note briefly that they
claim that the value of $\text{Ro}$ is strongly dependent upon the Prandtl number studied, and
that low Ro can be achieved at high Pr without achieving a rotationally constrained flow.
We studied only $\text{Pr} = 1$ here, and leave it to future work to determine if
the scaling of $\text{Ro}_{\text{p}} \propto \text{Pr}^{-1/4}$ is the correct scaling to
predict the evolved Rossby number.

Despite the added complexity of stratification and despite our using stress-free rather than
no-slip boundaries, the boundary layer scaling arguments put forth in \cite{king&all2012} seem
to hold up in our systems. This is reminiscent of what we found in \AB, in which
convection in stratified domains, regardless of Mach number, produced boundary-layer
dominated scaling laws of Nu that were nearly identical to the scaling laws found in
Boussinesq \RB convection.

We close by noting that once \pro$\,$ is chosen such that a convective system has the same
Rossby number as an astrophysical object of choice, it is straightforward to increase the 
turbulent nature of 
simulations by increasing Ra, just as in the non-rotating case.
Although all the results reported here are for a Cartesian geometry with 
antiparallel gravity and rotation, preliminary 3D spherical simulations suggest that 
\pro$\,$ also specifies Ro in more complex geometries (Brown et al. 2019 in prep).
