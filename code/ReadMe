Description of contents:
This tarball contains a stripped down version of the Exoweather team's
polytrope repository. The code contained herein is the code that was used
to run the simulations in this paper, but the repository is living and
is constantly being updated. It is open source and can be found online at
https://bitbucket.org/exoweather/polytrope

We have only included the files necessary to run our polytrope simulations,
namely:

FC_poly.py (the python3 run script for the simulations)
stratified_dynamics/atmospheres.py (logic and class definitions)
stratified_dynamics/equations.py (logic and class definitions)
stratified_dynamics/polytropes.py (logic and class definitions)
tools/analysis.py  (misc)
tools/checkpointing.py (checkpointing logic for restarting simulations)

An example run script for the NASA Pleiades supercomputer is found in
the file `sample_run_script'. Lines 19-36 of that file provide an example
of how to run the code in a terminal.

-----
System requirements:
This code must be run using python3 on a computer with the open-source
Dedalus pseudospectral framework installed. See http://dedalus-project.org/
for more information.

Additional comments:
For basic post-processing scripts, see the up-to-date polytrope repository,
or contact the first author, Evan Anders, for other tools.
